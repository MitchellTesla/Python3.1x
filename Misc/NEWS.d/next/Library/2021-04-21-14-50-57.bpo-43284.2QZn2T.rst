platform.win32_ver derives the windows version from
sys.getwindowsversion().platform_version which in turn derives the version
from kernel32.dll (which can be of a different version than Windows itself).
Therefore change the platform.win32_ver to determine the version using the
platform module's _syscmd_ver private function to return an accurate
version.
